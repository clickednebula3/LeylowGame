{Intro}
You wake up and notice you're healing from damage.
You're in a Bed and you don't remember anything.
Leylow introduces himself.
He's an adventurer who found you "fainted" in the woods.
He asks you for your name, which you do not remember.
Leylow lets you stay the night. He lost/forgot something in the forest, so he will bring it.

*Choice: [Stay/Sleep] - [Search Forest]

[Sleep]
	You wake up the next day. (see {Day 1})
	You find Leylow sleeping with the sleeping bag.
	He got you your hat back!
	He said it fell when he tried to bring you here.
[Search Forest]
	Very calm atmosphere, you grow sleepy.
	You face some Sleepy slimes and Anxious bunnies that you can just dodge.
	There is not really a danger unless you disturb a slime a lot tbh.
	Eventually, you find leylow.
	He got you your hat back!
	He said it fell when he tried to bring you home.
	He likes your adventuring spririt, but it's really late and you two should sleep.
	
	Next day, Leylow wakes you up energatically!

{Day 1}
He asks if you got your memory back. (no)
He makes a deal:
You get to live in his house as his roommate, as long as you also become his adventure-mate and go on some adventures with him!
At least until you get your memory.
Leylow: oh I'll even help you get your memory back!
